Established in 1988, the
AIDS Foundation of South Africa (AFSA)*This is from the official AFSA website*
was the first registered AIDS Non-Governmental Organisation in South Africa
Focusing on Combination Prevention and Treatment, Child Protection and Wellbeing, Food Security and Income Generation, AFSA aims to deliver quality services to communities most in need. Policy and Practice through the promotion of equality, education and access to basic services is a cornerstone of these efforts.
 AFSA recognises that the HIV epidemic is rooted in social and relational phenomena conditioned by environmental, cultural, political and socio-economic drivers. Given the complex reality that HIV affects communities and subgroups differently, AFSA uses strategies that address the social and structural drivers of HIV/AIDS and integrates interventions into a broader sexual and reproductive health framework. AFSA focuses on geographies and populations with elevated risk, thereby effectively and efficiently maximizing prevention impact.
 AFSA’s work is oriented around UNAID’s 95-95-95 global target, which calls for countries to achieve the following by 2030:
<ul>•	95% of all people living with HIV know their status</ul>
<ul>•	95% Of people within the subpopulation who are living with HIV who know their HIV status are on antiretroviral therapy</ul>
<ul>•	95% Of people within the subpopulation who are on antiretroviral therapy have suppressed viral loads</ul>
<p>In order to address the current prevention gap in Eastern and Southern Africa, AFSA’s strategic plan takes the 95-95-95 target into account as it works towards closing the gap in testing, treatment and care.</p>
